VSS2SVN has been tested in the following environment:
* VSS 2005 client version 8.0.50727.1551.
* SVN server used is VisualSVN, version 1.6.3.
* SVN windows client used is TortoiseSVN version 1.5.6, build 14908.
* SharpSVN version is 1.5005.984.35067
* Sourcesafe interop assembly version is 5.2.0.0.

I would advise that you take the time to see if there is an 
update to SharpSVN (http://sharpsvn.open.collab.net/) before
running the VSS2SVN utility.

I would also *strongly* advise you to try the migration on a
test repository before going over the real thing.
